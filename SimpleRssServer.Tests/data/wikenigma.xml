        <summary>&#039;Penguin&#039; etymology

The origin of the English word &#039;Penguin&#039; is obscure.

It&#039;s been suggested that it may have come from the Welsh words pen - meaning &#039;head&#039; - and gwyn - meaning &#039;white&#039;.

Though, notably, many penguins don&#039;t have white heads, and are scarce in Wales.</summary>

        <summary>Electrical activity in fungi

It&#039;s been established that many species of fungi generate small electric potentials (c. 100 mV) in their webs of underground fibres.

It&#039;s unknown what significance these electrical potentials may or may not have. Some research groups have suggested that they could form the basis of &#039;signals&#039; between fungi - or even between the fungi and nearby plants.</summary>

        <summary>The Liar Paradox

The Liar Paradox is a logic problem that goes back (at least) as far as the Ancient Greeks.

Example :

A known liar, who never tells the truth, says &quot;I am lying&quot;. If he is, as usual, lying, then his statement is false - meaning that he&#039;s telling the truth. Leading to a seemingly unsolvable paradoxical situation.</summary>

Forest rings are persistent, large-scale unusual growth ´rings´ (circular or oval) which can form in boreal forests. They are typically 50m - 2,000m across. The edge borders of the rings tend to feature a depression about 3m deep, and can be 10-30m in width.</summary>

Spontaneous remission (a.k.a. spontaneous recession and spontaneous regression ) refers to the rare but very well documented phenomenon of recovery from medically diagnosed cancers of various types.* See note

	&quot;The rare but spectacular phenomenon of spontaneous remission of cancer persists in the annals of medicine, totally inexplicable but real, a hypothetical straw to clutch in the search for cure. From time to time patients turn up with far advanced cancer, be…</summary>
